# Prescripto

**Project Description: Prescripto**

Prescripto is an integrated healthcare platform with three main roles: User, Doctor, and Admin. It is designed to provide an efficient, user-friendly experience for managing appointments, doctor interactions, and administrative tasks. The project consists of three primary folders: **frontend**, **backend**, and **admin**, each serving a distinct purpose.

1. **User Features:**
   - Users can log in and create profiles, book appointments with their preferred doctors based on specialties, and pay online through Razorpay.
   - Users can view and manage all their appointments, cancel or reschedule them, and edit their profiles.
   - Users can filter and view a list of doctors based on their specialties.

2. **Doctor Features:**
   - Doctors can log in and update their profiles, view their appointment schedules, and manage their availability by marking themselves as available/unavailable.
   - Doctors can check a list of patients, cancel or mark appointments as completed, and track their revenue through a dashboard.

3. **Admin Features:**
   - Admins can add new doctors to the platform and manage their availability.
   - Admins have access to a list of all doctors and patients, and they can cancel appointments if necessary.
   - The admin dashboard offers an overview of all activities, including doctor and patient management.

The project is designed to streamline healthcare services, offering easy appointment booking, management, and real-time updates for users, doctors, and administrators.
